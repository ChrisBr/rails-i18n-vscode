## Known Issues

- default locale is only detected in `config/application.rb` at the moment (first found locale key is used instead if config can not be found)
- when removing keys from yamls files, the removed keys are still suggested in autocompletion

## Release Notes

## Roadmap
- [ ] add a setting which when enabled shows translations in all available locales on hover
- [ ] go to location of translation in yaml file with go-to-definition
- [ ] go-to-definition does create key in yaml file if it does not already exist
